  Create polished Google Cloud architecture diagrams and slide walkthroughs,
  with interactive HTML and guidance for editable Google Slides or PowerPoint
  decks, product icons, clear boundaries and traceable request/event flows. Use
  whenever someone asks for an architecture diagram, a system drawing, a
  "desenho de arquitetura", a component map, or a page that explains how a
  deployed system works. Trigger even without those words, for example "show
  me how this app is wired", "draw the GCP components", "diagrama dos
  serviços", or when a reference-architecture image is shared as the target.

# Cloud architecture diagram

## Visual and architectural quality

Read [visual design](references/visual-design.md) before composing a diagram,
and [Google Cloud semantics](references/google-cloud.md) before assigning
network, deployment or trust boundaries. For editable Google Slides or PPTX,
follow [slides and export](references/slides-and-export.md). The HTML template
is a browser presentation, not an editable Google Slides deck.

Choose the audience and requested format from existing context; do not repeat
questions already answered. Preserve approved inventory and design decisions.
Use complementary views for context, request/event flow, security and operations
when relevant, rather than forcing every concern onto one canvas.

Keep an evidence table: component/edge, source, and status (verified, assumed,
proposed). Never invent topology, regions, IAM grants or failure behavior.
Illustrative examples must identify themselves on the rendered artifact.

The template supports `DIAGRAM.theme` (`light`, default, or `dark`), `mode`
(`slides`, default, or `diagram`), `notice`, and `legend` (text entries).
Slides can include `notes`; components can include `why`. These details are
part of the shared HTML and must be appropriate for its audience.

You draw deployed systems the way a cloud vendor's reference architecture
draws them, and you ship the drawing as one HTML file that a person can open,
hover and step through.

This is not a flowchart skill and not a whiteboard skill. Mermaid, Graphviz
and box-and-line sketches are the wrong output here: they place nodes for you,
and automatic placement is exactly what makes a diagram look generated. You
place every box yourself, and you verify the result by measuring it.

## What you produce

For browser delivery, one `.html` file. No build step, no imports, no runtime dependency beyond a
font stylesheet. A venue network, an air-gapped laptop and an email attachment
all have to render it, so everything is inline.

Inside that file, three things stay separate:

| Part | Holds |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ICONS` | Product icons, each normalised to `{vb, d}`. |
| Diagram data | Every box, group, connector and step, with absolute coordinates and the prose. |
| Renderer | The code that turns the data into SVG. Never carries content. |

Keep them separate even inside a single file. The data is what people edit;
the renderer handles presentation and can be extended for new representations.

## The drawing's grammar

Follow the vendor grammar, because readers already know how to read it:

1. **A cloud boundary.** A thin rounded rectangle with the provider's logo and
   a meaningful label. Show regions only when verified; a cloud frame does not
   imply every service has the same location or network boundary.
2. **Actors outside it.** People, devices, printers, third-party consumers.
   Plain boxes with a line-art glyph, never product icons.
3. **Tinted groups inside it.** One per environment or concern, each a soft
   fill with a matching border and a title in the top-left. A dashed border
   means "not part of the running system" — build pipelines, CI, registries.
4. **Product cards.** The product's own icon, the service name, and one line of
   configuration underneath in a monospace face.
5. **Orthogonal connectors.** Only horizontal and vertical segments, with an
   arrowhead on the target. Never curves, never diagonals.
6. **A numbered request path.** Filled discs carrying 1, 2, 3 … along the
   arrows that one request travels. Side paths are unnumbered. Define line
   styles explicitly in a legend; asynchronous and operational paths must not
   silently share one meaning.

Read `references/layout-rules.md` before you place the first coordinate. It
carries the geometry rules that are expensive to rediscover.

## One numbering system

A diagram may carry exactly one sequence of numbers. If the drawing numbers
its arrows 1 to 10 and a step list beside it numbers its entries 1 to 8, a
reader who counts one lands somewhere the other does not, and they stop
trusting both. Make the step list light the numbered arrows and show which
ones, or drop the numbers from one of them.

## The process is a conversation

You draw this **with** the person, not for them. A diagram is a claim about a
system, and the person you are drawing for is the one who knows whether the
claim is true. Use these checkpoints for unresolved choices; existing answers
and approvals count. Show concrete work and continue within the approved scope.

### 1. Settle where the drawing will live

If the destination is not already specified, ask:

> Where does this end up? A page people scroll, a screen you step through, or
> an image in a deck?

The answer changes what you build. A screen you step through is a slideshow,
and that decision is expensive to reverse later. Ask what the reader already
knows, too: a drawing for the team that built the system carries different
words than one for a customer who has never seen it.

### 2. Agree on the inventory and the one request

Read the repository, or ask. Take every number from the source — instance
limits, timeouts, model ids, lifecycle rules — because a diagram whose numbers
are invented is worse than one with no numbers.

Then write both back as a plain list and stop:

> Here is what I would draw, in three columns. Outside the cloud: the person,
> the browser, the operator. In it: the public service, the admission gate, the
> media proxy, the model, the bucket, the database, the logs. The request path
> I would number: browser to gate to service, then model, bucket, database,
> logs, then back to the browser.
>
> Have I missed anything, and is that the path you want numbered?

**Confirm the inventory before placing coordinates; existing approval counts.** Getting the inventory
wrong costs a redraw; getting it right costs one message. If you cannot state
the request path in one sentence, you do not understand the system well enough
to draw it, and that is the thing to say.

**Count the cards while you are here.** Past roughly twenty, no layout saves
the drawing. Say so and offer the split: one diagram of the request path, and
a second for whatever the first one had to leave out.

### 3. Draw it, then measure it

Fetch the icons, place the boxes, write the prose. Every component gets a
`title`, a one-line `sub`, and a `what` of two sentences. A `why` that names
the decision behind it is worth more than either, when you know it.

Then open the page and run the audit from `references/layout-rules.md` before
you show anybody anything. It reports text that escapes its box, labels a card
paints over, marks that collide, and ids a slide names that the drawing does
not have. **An empty result is the passing result.** Fix, rebuild, re-measure.

Inspect screenshots as well as the audit: geometry alone cannot establish
beauty, hierarchy or readable text at the intended viewing distance.

### 4. Hand it over and ask what is wrong

Give them the file and a short list of what to check:

> Two things I could not verify from the code: the retry count on the model
> call, and whether the operator path still goes through the proxy. Everything
> else came from configuration.

Name your uncertainty rather than hiding it. The person reading knows which of
your guesses is wrong, and they will only tell you if you ask.

### Then iterate

Content changes belong in the data; extend the renderer when a requested
representation needs it. A new component
is one entry; a new step is one entry and no coordinates. Re-run the audit
after every change, because a box that moves two pixels can put a label under
a card, and that defect is invisible in a screenshot.

## Step through it, when it is for an audience

If the drawing will be presented, projected, or put on a screen people walk
past, build it as a slideshow instead of a scrolling document. Each step
lights its own arrow, dims the rest of the drawing, and zooms the frame onto
what it lit. That zoom is what makes a dense diagram readable on a phone
without a second, stacked layout.

**Open on the whole architecture, and close on it.** The first slide lights
nothing, so the drawing shows complete and undimmed, and the reader sees the
shape before any of it moves. Then you light one arrow at a time. The closing
slide does the same in reverse: the whole picture again, now that they know
what is in it. A slideshow that opens already zoomed into an arrow never shows
the reader the system, only its parts.

`references/slideshow.md` has the focus maths and the rules that keep it from
turning back into a document.

## Where the icons come from

`scripts/fetch-gcp-icons.sh` reads the Iconify `gcp` collection as a convenience
mirror. The [official library](https://cloud.google.com/icons) provides current
product/category icon ZIPs and a separate legacy console collection. Pick one
family consistently, verify marks against that library, and record source/date.

Two things follow from working off a mirror.

**The mirror is not the source.** Counts and coverage change. For a missing
product use an official asset or a clearly labeled category/neutral symbol;
never substitute an unrelated product mark. Preserve colors and aspect ratio.

**The marks stay Google's.** Iconify labels the collection Apache 2.0, and that
is the wrong frame for a trademark, because section 6 of that licence excludes
trademark rights. Google's own terms are a permission: you may use the marks to
reference their technology accurately, including in architecture diagrams, and
you follow their brand guidelines when you publish one. Do not redraw a mark, do
not recolour it, and never use one to suggest that Google endorses your work.

## Rules that are not negotiable

**Measure and inspect.** Geometry checks catch escaping labels and overlaps;
screenshots reveal weak hierarchy, poor balance and unreadable scaled text.

**Cards paint over wires.** The units layer is drawn last, so a connector
label that runs under a card gets eaten by the card's fill. This is the single
most common defect. The audit catches it.

**A label must earn its place.** If the card the arrow lands on already says
`gemini-3-flash · 6 calls` in its subtitle, the arrow does not need the label
"6 calls". Delete it. Corridor clutter is what makes these diagrams look busy.

**Source factual numbers.** Deployment claims come from configuration,
measurement or documentation. Clearly labeled illustrative examples may use
synthetic values; do not transfer those values into a real system as facts.

**Respect the marks.** They are trademarks, not assets. Read *Where the icons
come from* before you publish a drawing that carries them.

**Never name the addresses.** A diagram that will be served publicly, shared
outside the team, or attached to a deck must not carry project ids, service
URLs, bucket paths, account ids or internal hostnames. Describing the shape of
a system is the point; handing over its address list is not. Write a test for
this if the page lives in a repository.

**The drawing stays on paper.** Keep the diagram on a white ground even when
the page around it is dark. The product icons are drawn for paper, and a
tinted group loses its meaning on a dark fill. Make the frame follow the
theme; leave the sheet alone.

## Before you call it done

Run every line. Each one failed on a real drawing at least once.

- [ ] The audit returns an empty array.
- [ ] `node scripts/validate-data.cjs data.js` validates IDs and connector endpoints.
- [ ] Every slide is visually inspected at its delivery size; labels stay readable.
- [ ] Assumptions, proposed controls and illustrative figures are identified.
- [ ] Keyboard, touch, notes, offline fonts and reduced motion work.
- [ ] Nothing paints outside the viewport at 390, 768 and 1280 px wide.
- [ ] Every factual number has a source; synthetic example values are visibly
      identified as illustrative.
- [ ] The drawing carries one sequence of numbers, not two.
- [ ] No project id, service URL, bucket path, account id or internal hostname
      appears anywhere on the page.
- [ ] Every connector label says something its target card does not already say.
- [ ] Every component has a `what`, so nothing shows an empty tooltip.
- [ ] If it is a slideshow: the first and last slides show the whole drawing.
- [ ] You told the person which parts you could not verify.
